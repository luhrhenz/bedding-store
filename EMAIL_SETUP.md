## ðŸ”’ Security & GitHub Safety

Your sensitive credentials are now protected with environment variables:

- âœ… **`.env` files are gitignored** - Won't be pushed to GitHub
- âœ… **Credentials loaded securely** - Using Vite's environment variable system
- âœ… **No hardcoded secrets** - All sensitive data is externalized

### Before Pushing to GitHub:
1. Ensure `.env` is NOT committed (it's already in `.gitignore`)
2. Only commit `.env.example` (template file)
3. Set up your actual credentials locally in your `.env` file

### For Production Deployment:
- Set environment variables in your hosting platform
- Never commit real credentials to version control
- Use different credentials for production vs development
